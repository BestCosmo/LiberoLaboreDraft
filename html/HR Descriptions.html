    <h2 id="Spac" class="subTitle">Right to ownership of living space and or rental of communal space</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In Libero Labore, all citizens 18 or older are entitled to receive a living space. There are two types: 1 bedroom and 3 bedroom. All 1 bedroom living spaces are the same size with the same number and type of rooms. Same goes for 4 bedroom living spaces. If one wishes to start a family, they are entitled to upgrade into a 4 bedroom living space. Parents are required to downgrade into a 1 bedroom living space when children move out. Living and communal spaces are completely empty on the inside to be fully furnished and designed by their owner.
        <br><br>
        Communal space may include gyms, art/dance studios etc. These can be rented short to indefinite periods of times by anyone 18 or older. If a communal space is not used for up to 2 weeks, it must be relinquished by the owner. Uses could include dinner parties, clubs, theatres, research labs etc. Communal spaces are fully customisable in size and design. Ranging from a large warehouse to a small office.
        <br><br>
        Communal spaces are very important for culture and community. In dystopias like 1984 and Brave new world, forced community activities were the only things that stopped the societies collapsing. Although Libero Labore won’t enforce its communal activates (unlike the aforementioned dystopias), I think people will still attend classes and other things, for the same reason we attend community events in our current world.<br><br>

        This gives you the right to:<br>
        - be allocated living space when old enough<br>
        - request a different living space due to necessity or preference<br>
        - receive a larger living space to accommodate a family<br>
        - rent available communal space if old enough<br>
        - right to increase or decrease size of rented communal space<br><br>

        Exceptions:<br>
        Incarcerated citizens are not liable to receive living space or rent communal space.<br><br>
    </p>



    <h2 id="Rbot" class="subTitle">Right to access of Robots</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Robots in Libero Labore are essentially the slaves of society. Everyone is entitled to the vast usages of these robots.<br><br>
        
        This gives you the right to:<br>
        - Use robots for personal use from the age 18 and older<br>
        - Request access to fewer or greater robots<br><br>

        Exceptions:<br>
        Incarcerated citizens may not access robots directly, rather indirectly through their warden.<br>
